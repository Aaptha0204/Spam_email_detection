# spam_email_detection
Classifies whether the email is a spam using sklearn's naive Bayes algorithm.

You need to upload the file from your google drive. Therefore make sure the "spam.csv" file is IN your drive. 

In this project we will be using various sklearn libraries such as CountVectorizer, MultinomialNB, train_test_split etc. 

The accuracy of the ML model is approximately 98 %. You can use your own datasets and try for different values.

Thank You!
